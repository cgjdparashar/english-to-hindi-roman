Lila, a curious young girl from a quiet village, found an old key buried beneath a tree in her backyard. Intrigued, she searched for its lock and discovered a forgotten shed filled with dusty books and peculiar trinkets. Each item told a story, and as she explored, she realized the shed had once belonged to her great-grandfather, a traveling storyteller. Inspired, Lila began writing her own tales, unlocking not just the shedâ€™s secrets, but her imagination too.
